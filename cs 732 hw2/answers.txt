1.
In the class, I will add a title longwritable. In the loop, I will set its value and return with filetime such as 20160801-00000 and a pair that contains the title and count.

2.
flatMap is applying the function to every row of data and then flatten it.
map is only applying the function and it does not flatten the stream.

I think flatMap is more like mapReduce because that it can map 1 input to n output and it's just like mapReduce.

3.
The reduce only reduces one final value.
The reduceByKey has value for each key and can remain RDD and have further transformation done.

I think the reduceByKey is more like the MapReduce concept of reducing. Because 

4.
I use the max to find the highest number of page views and I can update this function with a if to save data when there is a tie.
Then I will use list to contain all pages of highest number.
The update of max function and list of all pages of highest number will be necessary. The return should be the filetime such as 20160801-00000 and list of all acceptable pages and count.
